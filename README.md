# busybear-linux

busybear-linux is a tiny RISC-V Linux root filesystem image that targets
the `virt` machine in riscv-qemu. As the name suggests, busybear-linux is
a riscv-linux root image comprised of busybox and dropbear.

The root image is intended to demonstrate virtio-net and virtio-block in
riscv-qemu and features a dropbear ssh server which allows out-of-the-box
ssh access to a RISC-V virtual machine.

See the [releases](https://github.com/michaeljclark/busybear-linux/releases)
for pre-built kernel and filesystem images.

## Dependencies

- [riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain) (RISC-V Linux toolchain)
- [busybox](https://busybox.net/) (downloaded automatically)
- [dropbear](https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html) (downloaded automatically)
- sudo, curl, openssl and rsync

## Features

- `ntpd` for time configuration
- `klog` for kernel logging
- `syslog` for system logging
- `dropbear` for ssh access
- `busybox` with almost everything enabled

## Configuration

- `conf` contains the linux image build configuration
  - `conf/linux.config` contains the linux-kernel configuration
  - `conf/busybox.config` contains the busybox configuration
  - `conf/busybear.config` contains the image build configuration
    - `ROOT_PASSWORD=busybear`
    - `IMAGE_FILE=busybear.bin`
- `etc` contains the linux guest system configuration
  - `etc/network/interfaces` (guest 192.168.100.2, router 192.168.100.1)
  - `etc/resolv.conf` (nameserver 8.8.8.8, nameserver 8.8.4.4)
  - `etc/ntp.conf` (server 0.pool.ntp.org, server 1.pool.ntp.org)
  - `etc/passwd`, `etc/shadow`, `etc/group` and `etc/hosts`

The default config assumes bridged networking with `192.168.100.1`
on the host and `192.168.100.2` in the guest.

## Build

The build process downloads busybox and dropbear, compiles them and prepares
a root filesystem image to the file `busybear.bin`. The build script needs
to be run in Linux, even if preparing a root filesystem image for macOS.

### busybear-linux

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/michaeljclark/busybear-linux.git
cd busybear-linux
make
```

### QEMU

```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-qemu.git
cd riscv-qemu
./configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu,riscv32-softmmu
make
```

### riscv-linux

_Note: busybear-linux builds linux kernel automatically_

```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux.git
cd riscv-linux
git checkout riscv-linux-4.14
cp ../busybear-linux/conf/linux.config .config
make ARCH=riscv olddefconfig
make ARCH=riscv vmlinux
```

### bbl

_Note: busybear-linux builds bbl automatically_

```
git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pk.git
cd riscv-pk
mkdir build
cd build
../configure \
    --enable-logo \
    --host=riscv64-unknown-elf \
    --with-payload=../../riscv-linux/vmlinux
make
```

## Running

busybear requires the riscv-qemu `virt` board with virtio-block
and virtio-net devices.

The following command starts busybear-linux:

```
./scripts/start-qemu.sh
```

which runs executes this command:

```
sudo qemu-system-riscv64 -nographic -machine virt \
  -kernel bbl -append "root=/dev/vda ro console=ttyS0" \
  -drive file=busybear.bin,format=raw,id=hd0 \
  -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
  -netdev type=tap,script=scripts/ifup.sh,downscript=scripts/ifdown.sh,id=net0 \
  -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0
```

After booting the virtual machine you should be able to ssh into it.

```
$ ssh root@192.168.100.2

## linux bridged networking

### bridge

`/etc/network/interfaces`
```
iface br0 inet static
  bridge_ports eth0
  address 192.168.100.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  network 192.168.100.0
  broadcast 192.168.100.255
```

### ifup script

```
#!/bin/sh

brctl addif br0 $1
ifconfig $1 up
```

### ifdown script

```
#!/bin/sh

ifconfig $1 down
brctl delif br0 $1
```

## macOS bridged networking

These steps show how to setup tuntap bridged networking on macOS:

### install tuntap

Note: the tuntap driver installation requires authorization in the
macOS Security and Privacy section of System Preferences.

```
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install caskroom/cask/tuntap
```

### create bridge

```
sudo ifconfig bridge1 create
sudo ifconfig bridge1 192.168.100.1/24
```

### ifup script

```
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig bridge1 addm $1
```

### ifdown script

```
#!/bin/sh
ifconfig bridge1 deletem $1
```

### pfctl.rules (packet filter rules)

```
nat on en0 from { 192.168.100.0/24 } to any -> (en0)
pass from {lo0, 192.168.100.0/24} to any keep state
```

### NAT forwarding (guest access to the Internet)

```
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
sudo pfctl -e
sudo pfctl -F all
sudo pfctl -f pfctl.rules 
```
